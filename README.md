# Royal Grenadier
Implementation of Mojang's Brigadier for PaperMC

**Requires Java 11+ and Paper**

All classes in net.forthecrown.grenadier are considered API. While classes in net.forthecrown.royalgrenadier are considered internal and shouldn't be used unless neccessary.

## Using the RoyalGrenadier in a project
Unfortunately there isn't currently a maven repository for this project.
To use the RoyalGrenadier, you'll have to download the jar and add it as a dependency, and add it to your server's plugins as well.

To get Brigadier itself, head over to the [Brigadier repo](https://github.com/Mojang/brigadier) and get the dependency from there.

## Usage
Check out the [Wiki](https://github.com/BotulToxin/RoyalGrenadier/wiki/Creating-a-command) for info on creating commands.
